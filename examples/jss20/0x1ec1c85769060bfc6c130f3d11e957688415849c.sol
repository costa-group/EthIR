/* This DAO Covenant Agreement ("DCA") is entered into by and among 
the owners of the Ethereum blockchain network ("Ethereum") addresses that 
provide their authorized digital signatures by 
calling the *signDCA* Solidity function embedded below (“DAO Participants”).

WHEREAS,

The DAO Participants have agreed to enter into this DCA for the purpose of 
regulating the exercise of their rights in relation to digital organizations 
operating on Ethereum ("DAOs");

NOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, 
for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, 
the DAO Participants agree as follows: 

1. The DAO Participants shall actively participate in the governance of the DAOs 
in which they have a voting or similar stake on Ethereum ("Affiliated DAOs").

2. The DAO Participants shall support the stated purposes of Affiliated DAOs,
and refrain from any action that may conflict with or harm such purposes.

3. The DAO Participants shall comply in all respects with all relevant laws 
to which they may be subject, if failure to do so would materially impair their  
performance under obligations to Affiliated DAOs.

4. The DAO Participants shall not sell or transfer or otherwise 
dispose of in any manner (or purport to do so) all or any part of, 
or any interest in, Affiliated DAOs, 
unless otherwise authorized and in compliance with applicable law.

5. The results of proper operation of Affiliated DAOs shall be determinative in 
the rights and obligations of, and shall be final, binding upon and non-appealable by, 
the DAO Participants with regard to such DAOs and their assets.
 
6. All claims and disputes arising under or relating to Affiliated DAOs 
shall be settled by binding arbitration.

7. This DCA constitutes legally valid obligations binding and enforceable 
among the DAO Participants in accordance with its terms, 
and shall be governed by the choice of New York law.

8. Digital Signatories to this DCA may opt out of the adoption pool 
established hereby upon calling the *revokeDCA* Solidity function embedded below */

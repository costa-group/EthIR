*
*   SMRT16 is a practical implementation of the idea of Decentralized Unmanaged Organization (DUO). 
*   The DUO is about that there are possible businesses which operate on-chain only and make profit absolutely without any external management.
*   
*   SMRT16 project consists of this smart contract "SMRT16Ext" (this file) and two another:
*    1) PROFIT SHARING "ProfitSharingSMRT16"
*    2) PROFIT ACCUMULATOR "ProfitAccamulatorSMRT16"
*   These two are dependent and working together with the SMRT16Ext, covering the minimum of the functionality needed to create a fully operational business.
*   
*   SMRT16Ext first of all describes SMRT16 Token, which is a MiniMe Token (from Jordi Baylina) and which implements the ERC20 interface as well. 
*   As soon it is ERC20, it can be freely transferred, sold, bought and exchanged.  
*   As soon it is MiniMe token, SMRT16 has the feature to remember users' stakes at any Ethereum block.
*   The last needed to make this token to work like shares, so our DUO can pay dividends. 
*   
*   The dividends need to be claimed and are not paid automatically. 
*   It accrued and paid in ETH cryptocurrency, monthly, proportionally to the stakes holded on the end of a month.
*   
*   The dividends at least once per year, otherwise it's recycled. Recycled amount treated as profit and comes to the next period for all shareholders.
*   
*   The big thing about SMRT16 is decentralization of marketing which is built in the token sale. 
*   Unlike other projects, SMRT16 is not going to raise any funds for the development. The funds from the token sale are instantly paid back 
*   to the project participants as marketing bonuses. 
*   The goal of the project is to raise the people's attention which later will be monetized for the long lasting profit again back for investors of the project.
*   Token sale has a multi level referral program, which is that decentralized marketing mentioned above.
*   It works the following way: every project participant has his own "PersonalSMRT16" Smart Contract address, which was created for him during the first token purchase. 
*   With this address the user becomes an agent of the project and now he can invite other people to buy SMRT16 tokens by paying ETH to his personal address.
*   In this case the agent gets up to half of every sale transaction of his 1st level referrals. 
*   There are four levels of referrals. Every next level of referrals has the half of the previous level. 
*   This looks like 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and 1/16 of the original transaction amount.
*   All together it makes that 15/16 of the token price are spent to pay for the marketing efforts of the project investors. 
*   Note: everything paid in ETH instantly. 
*   The remaining 1/16 of the token price, together with any other incomes goes to "ProfitAccamulatorSMRT16" address and paid out as dividends at the end of every month.
*   
*   What after the token sale the project is going to make money with a number of coming soon Smart contracts. Let's like slots and so on. 
*   Which are supposed to get traffic by the efforts of all the big number of investors involved during the token sale and referral marketing campaign.
*

/*
 * Author: Patrick McCorry (anydot)
 *
 * An on-chain competition to win prize money.
 *
 * How to enter:
 * Developers simply need to call submit() and send it via the any.sender service.
 *
 * - Skills required to play:
 * All tickets must be sent via the any.sender service, so it requires techncial skill (e.g. developer)
 * to participate in the competition. We have added some extra "ticket bumps" during the game,
 * so it might be worth writing a script that can watch out for the bumps to purchase extra tickets.
 *
 * - How it works:
 * Users can have one or more tickets, and all tickets are appended to a list.
 * When the game ends, we'll use the blockhash as a random beacon and it will
 * a random index in the list of tickets. Whoever owns that ticket is the winner.
 * We took inspiration from https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2008-StajanoCla-cyberdice.pdf
 *
 * - Minting tickets:
 * We have added rules on how the tickets are minted, so please
 * check out getNoTickets() for up to date information.
 *
 * - Why did we make a competition?
 * It really demonstrates the power of Ethereum and the any.sender service.

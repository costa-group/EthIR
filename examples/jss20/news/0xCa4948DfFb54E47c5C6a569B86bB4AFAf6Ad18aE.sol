 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 *

 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How

 *

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead

 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.

 *

 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.

 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just

 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit

 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

 *

 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

/* Description:
 * A sustainable economic model for
 * DFO-based Startups to maintain value
 * and funds operations
 * 
 * Abstract:
 * 
 * Voting Tokens of Decentralized Flexible Organizations are real programmable equities of a
 * protocol because the funds locked into a DFO wallet are actually funds in the hand of token
 * holders. DFO funds can be transferred or used only by voting, this opens new and very
 * interesting correlations between Private Equity and Tokens.
 * The core experiment of this paper is to explore how adding new on-chain valuable assets into a
 * DFO wallet can sustain the price of its voting tokens.
 * In a traditional company, if new assets are added to the Company funds (without any increase
 * of debts) the evaluation of its equities is backed by the value of these assets. This is because
 * equities holders have the power to manage these assets.
 * This basic rule can be applied to Decentralized Flexible Organizations because if funds are
 * added to a DFO wallet, Token Holders are the only ruler of these funds.
 * This is a basic design decision of The DFO core protocol, because thanks to its Smart contracts,
 * nobody can make actions outside of a public proposal voted by token holders.
 * 
 * The experiment:
 * 
 * Thanks to the Uniswap math design:
 * 
 * x * y = k. **
 * 
 * **Explained by Decrypt.co
 * In the equation, x and y represent the quantity of ETH and ERC20 tokens available in a liquidity pool and k is a
 * constant value. This equation uses the balance between the ETH and ERC20 tokens–and supply and demand–to
 * determine the price of a particular token. Whenever someone buys Poop Token with ETH, the supply of Poop Token
 * decreases while the supply of ETH increases–the price of Poop Token goes up. As a result, the price of tokens on
 * Uniswap can only change if trades occur. Essentially what Uniswap is doing it balancing out the value of tokens, and
 * the swapping of them based on how much people want to buy and sell them.
 * 
 * A Flexible Organization can sustain its operation by a fixed Circulated Supply inflation using the
 * uniswap protocol, by adding new values into the DFO Wallet:
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * A DFO named “Flexible” with a Voting Token named “FLX”
 * ● FLX Total Supply = 1.000.000 FLX
 * ● Flexible DFO Wallet = 800.000 FLX (80%)
 * ● FLX Circulating Supply = 200.000 FLX (20%)
 * With a Smart Contract based proposal, Flexible Token holders decide to step by step inflate the
 * circulating supply for a total of 5% during a period of a year and a half by selling a fixed number
 * of FLX once a week (~ 50.400 Ethereum Blocks @ 12 sec for a block for 80 times)
 * In this case, the Flexible DFO will sell in total 50.000 FLX on the Uniswap protocol at the ratio of
 * 625 FLX every 50.400 Blocks, increasing the circulating supply by the 0,0625%
 * (In this experiment technically the FLX backed value is already settled by the 800.000 FLX into the Flexible DFO
 * Wallet, but because the FLX is at the same time the Voting Token, we don’t count its value in this equation.)
 * Every FLX Inflation event will add new ETH to the Flexible DFO wallet, adding new backed
 * assets.
 * For example, after the first selling event the new status of the Flexible DFO Wallet will be:
 * 
 * 799375 FLX + Z ETH ***
 * 
 * ***(Z is equal to an amount of ETH depending on the ratio of ETH/FLX into the Uniswap Pool)
 * 
 * Now Z ETH is the minimum backed value of the Flexible DFO Wallet and consequently the FLX
 * Market cap because FLX Token Holders are the only people who can manage these funds, like
 * Equity Holders in a Company.
 * Every Selling Event the Uniswap Pool reaches very little inflation but at the same time this
 * selling benefits every FLX Holders.
 * If the DFO Voting Token Holders will use every week an amount < of the 100% of the Z ETH
 * funds reached, the project can pay operations and at the same time accumulate backed value
 * to benefit every token holder.
 * 
 * The DFOhub Experiment:
 * 
 * We want to do this experiment for three fundamental reasons:
 * 
 * 1) Empiric data about the correlation from Programmable Equities (DFO based Voting
 * Tokens) to Regular Equities that can open an infinite number of questions and business
 * opportunities for the dapps of tomorrow (DFO based)
 * 2) R&D and introduce these standardized Smart Contracts as optional basic functions for
 * every DFO via voting
 * 3) Sustain our operations and at the same time to build a minimum backed valorization for
 * BUIDL holders.
 * The Economics behind BUIDL is based on the Business Model of the General Purpose Protocol
 * DFO. Every time someone creates a new Decentralized Flexible Organization, a % of the new
 * DFO’s new Voting Tokens is added to the DFOhub Wallet. The DFOhub Wallet is managed only
 * by voting from the BUIDL holders, making assets into the DFOhub wallet the backed value of
 * BUIDL.
 * 
 * DFOhub Experiment in numbers:
 * ● BUIDL Total Supply = 42.000.000 BUIDL
 * ● DFOhub DFO Wallet = 11.500.000 BUIDL (27.3%)
 * ● DFOhub Team Operations Wallet = 11.500.000 BUIDL (27.3%)
 * ● BUIDL Circulating Supply = 2.200.000 BUIDL (5.2%)
 * 
 * With a Smart Contract based proposal, DFOhub will step by step inflate the circulating supply of
 * BUIDL for a total of 0.8% during a period of a year and a half by selling a fixed number of BUIDL
 * once every two weeks (~ 100.800 Ethereum Blocks @ 12 sec for a block for 40 times)
 * At the same time, the DFOhub Team Operations Wallet will step by step inflate the circulating
 * supply of BUIDL for a total of 0.8% during a period of a year and a half by selling a fixed number
 * of BUIDL once every two weeks (~ 100.800 Ethereum Blocks @ 12 sec for a block for 40 times)
 * These two Smart Contracts will inflate the circulation supply of a total of 1.6% (672.000 BUIDL)
 * in a year and a half. The funds will be inflated into 3 different Uniswap Pools:
 * 25% Uniswap V1 ETH/BUIDL | 0.4% (168.000 BUIDL)
 * 25% Uniswap V2 ETH/BUIDL | 0.4% (168.000 BUIDL)
 * 50% Uniswap V2 USDC/BUIDL | 0.8% Inflation (336.000 BUIDL)
 * During every Selling Event, the Circulating supply of BUIDL will increase by 0.02% (8.400
 * BUIDL) and will be split into:
 * 25% Uniswap V1 ETH/BUIDL | 0.005% (2.100 BUIDL)
 * 25% Uniswap V2 ETH/BUIDL | 0.005% (2.100 BUIDL)
 * 50% Uniswap V2 USDC/BUIDL | 0.01% Inflation (4.200 BUIDL)
 * Conclusion:
 * 
 * Every Two weeks these funds will create values for BUIDL holders in two different ways:
 * 1. From the DFOhub Wallet: Z ETH and Z USDC will be automatically added to the
 * DFOhub wallet as a backed value for BUIDL holders.
 * 2. From the DFOhub Team Operations Wallet, these funds will be used to accelerate the
 * R&D into new DFOhub Functionalities, Marketing, and Community Rewards. These
 * Operations will benefit all of the BUIDL holders accelerating the advancement of the
 * protocol and its usage, so more DFO's Voting Tokens into the DFOhub Wallet as a
 * backed value for BUIDL holders.
 * 
 * All of the functionalities related to this R&D will become available for every DFO as Optional
 * Basic Functionalities, to accelerate the exploration of Programmable Equities R&D.

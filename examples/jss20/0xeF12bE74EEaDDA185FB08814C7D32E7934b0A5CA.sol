// @title Game
// @notice A money game in which only one player can lose. Everyone else leaves with more money than they started with.
// Dozens may play. Only one will lose.
// @dev The UI will initially launch at playescalation.com. If that site ever goes down, look for an `Announce` event at
// https://etherscan.io/address/0xbea62796855548154464f6c8e7bc92672c9f87b8#events for where to find the latest UI.
// IMPORTANT: This is not an investment scheme. This is a game. There is up to one loser per game and that could be you.
// IMPORTANT: Do not play with more money than you are comfortable losing.
// IMPORTANT: It is *impossible* to get back any money you lose, because that money is used to pay out all the other players.
// IMPORTANT: The creators of this game have no control over this game or the payouts. This code is autonomous.
// IMPORTANT: By interacting with this contract you agree to not hold the creators responsible for any loses you may incur. Use it at your own risk.
// IMPORTANT: Have fun and play responsibly!
// @dev This game works as follows:
// - To ready the game, at least 0.0435 ETH is donated to the contract. Anyone can do this. It will probably be done by the game creators.
// - Then anyone can start the game by calling the `firstPlay` function, which requires staking exactly 0.05 ETH with this contract.
// - This starts a countdown clock that counts down from 30 minutes.
// - During the 30 minutes, anyone can play by calling the `play` function, which requires staking funds with this contract.
// - Each play of the game causes the countdown timer to be reset back to 30 minutes.
// - Each successive play of the game requires a stake that is exactly 15% larger than the previous stake.
// - The game ends when the countdown clock gets to 0.
// - If two or more people play after you then you are a "small winner" and you are instantly given your stake back plus an additional 10% profit.
// -    This "small winner" payout happens automatically, as soon as the second player after you plays.
// -    You do not need to wait until the game ends to get paid. You are paid out instantly, with no need to send a withdrawal transaction.
// - If nobody plays after you then you are a "big winner" and, when the clock gets to 0, you are given your stake back plus an additional 20% profit.
// -    This "big winner" payout happens automatically when the game is reset.
// -    Anyone can reset the game by calling the `reset` function. It costs only gas.
// - If *exactly one* other person has played after you when the countdown clock gets to 0 then you are the game's only loser. You lose your stake.
// -    That is, if you are the one sorry bastard who ends up in second place when the countdown clock gets to 0, you lose.
// -    The only way to lose money in this game is to be the second to last person who played.
// - TL;DR: So long as you are not in second place when the countdown clock gets to 0, you will leave with more money that you started with.
//
// NOTES:
// - It is okay for a person to play more than once during a game. Each deposit is treated as a distinct play. The identity of the depositor is not important.
//      For example, if you want to, you can put the profit won from an earlier play towards a later play. Or even play several times in a row.
// - If the countdown clock is getting close to 0 and you are in second place, one possible way to avoid losing your stake
//      is to play again (but only if you are comfortable putting more money at risk). This would knock your old play out of second place
//      so you would get it back immediately, along with 10% profit, and your new deposit would have a chance at being the "big winner".
// - This contract itself can accumulate funds over time. These funds are used to seed future rounds of the game.
//      This seeding of the next round happens automatically when the `reset` function is called.
// - If you ever find that nobody is paying attention to this contract and it has money in it, you can profit from that by being
//      the first player. If nobody else is paying attention then you will also be the last player because nobody will play after you.
//      This means you'll get your deposit back plus 20% profit. You can repeat this over and over until this contract is drained of all its funds.
// - To any copycats thinking of offering similar games and just tweaking the constants: please be very careful.
//      The maths behind the choice of constants is extremely sensitive, and it is easy to introduce critical insolvency vulnerabilities if you
//      don't know what you are doing. This contract was created and rigorously tested by experienced contract developers. If you want to make
//      changes to it please write full integration tests to be sure your choice of constants will not cause security issues.

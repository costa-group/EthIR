Initialization stage: Main Pool deploys this lottery contract,\n *      and calls initialize() with initial Ether funds provided.\n *      Lottery mints initial token supply and provides the liquidity\n *      to Uniswap, with whole token supply and initial Ether funds.\n *      Then, lottery becomes Active - trading tokens becomes allowed.\n *\n *  2. Active Stage:    Token transfers occurs on this stage, and \n *      finish probability is Zero. Our ETH funds in Uniswap increases\n *      in this stage.\n *      When certain criteria of holder count and fund gains are met,\n *      the Finishing stage begins.\n *  \n *  3. Finishing Stage:     It can be considered a second part of\n *      an Active stage, because all token transfers and Uniswap trading\n *      are still allowed and occur actively.\n *      However, on this stage, for every transfer, a pseudo-random\n *      number is rolled, and if that rolled number is below a specific\n *      threshold, lottery de-activates, and Ending stage begins, when\n *      token transfers are denied.\n *      The threshold is determined by Finish Probability, which\n *      increases on every transfer on this stage.\n *\n *      However, notice that if Finishing Criteria (holder count and\n *      fund gains) are no-longer met, Finishing Stage pauses, and\n *      we get back to Active Stage.\n *\n *  4. Ending-Mining Stage - Step One:\n *      On this stage, we Remove our contract\u0027s liquidity share\n *      from Uniswap, then transfer the profits to the Pool and\n *      the Owner addresses.\n *\n *      Then, we call the Randomness Provider, requesting the Random Seed,\n *      which later should be passed to us by calling our callback\n *      (finish_randomnessProviderCallback).\n *\n *      Miner, who completes this step, gets portion of Mining Rewards,\n *      which are a dedicated profit share to miners.\n *\n *  5. Ending-Mining Stage - Step Two:  On this stage, if  *\n *      However, if Randomness Provider hasn\u0027t given us a seed after\n *      specific amount of time, on this step, before starting the\n *      Winner Selection Algorithm, an Alternative Seed Generation\n *      is performed, where the pseudo-random seed is generated based\n *      on data in our and Storage contracts (transfer hash, etc.).\n *\n *      If we\u0027re using MinedWinnerSelection ending algorithm type, then\n *      on this step the miner performs the gas-intensive Winner Selection \n *      Algorithm, which involves complex score calculations in a loop, and\n *      then sorting the selected winners array.\n *\n *      Miner who successfully completes this step, gets a portion of\n *      the Mining Rewards.\n *\n *  6. Completion Stage (Winner Prize Claiming stage):  On this stage,\n *      the Lottery Winners can finally claim their Lottery Prizes,\n *      by calling a prize claim function on our contract.\n *\n *      If we\u0027re using WinnerSelfValidation ending algorithm, winner\n *      computes and validates his final score on this function by\n *      himself, so the prize claim transaction can be gas-costly.\n *\n *      However, is RolledRandomness or MinedWinnerSelection algorithms\n *      are used, this function is cheap in terms of gas.\n *\n *      However, if some of winners fail to claim their prizes after\n *      a specific amount of time (specified in config), then those\n *      prizes can then be claimed by Lottery Main Pool too.\n */\ncontract Lottery is ERC20, CoreUniLotterySettings\n{\n    // ===================== Events ===================== //\n\n    // After initialize() function finishes.\n    event LotteryInitialized();\n\n    // Emitted when lottery active stage ends (Mining Stage starts),\n    // on Mining Stage Step 1, after transferring profits to their\n    // respective owners (pool and OWNER_ADDRESS).\n    event LotteryEnd(\n        uint128 totalReturn,\n        uint128 profitAmount\n    );\n\n    // Emitted when on final finish, we call Randomness Provider\n    // to callback us with random value.\n    event RandomnessProviderCalled();\n\n    // Requirements for finishing stage start have been reached - \n    // finishing stage has started.\n    event FinishingStageStarted();\n\n    // We were currently on the finishing stage, but some requirement\n    // is no longer met.

EthIR

[![License: GPL v3][license-badge]][license-badge-url]


A framework for high-level Analysis of Ethereum Bytecode.
EthIR builds a complete and sound CFG of a Ethereum bytecode and generates a *rule-based representation* (RBR) of the program. This high-level representation enables the application of existing high-level analyses to infer properties of EVM code.

## Installation (Ubuntu)

### 1. Install Solidity compiler

Download the folder source that contains a static executable of Solidity compiler.
    
Add it to the PATH and test that it is installed.
    
```
 sudo cp source/solc* /usr/bin/
 sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/solc*
 solc --version
 solcv5 --version
 solcv6 --version
 ```
 
In case you want to install the latest version:
 
 ```
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install solc
```

In addition, it supports `solc-select`. In order to install it, run:
 ```
 pip3 install solc-select
 solc-select install all
```


### 2. Install Ethereum

A static executable is provided in the folder source.

Add ot to the PATh and test that it is installed.
 
 ```
 sudo cp source/evm* /usr/bin/
 sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/evm*
 evm --version
 ```
 In case you want to install the latest version:
  
```
 sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
 sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install ethereum
```

### 3. Install [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases) (last version tested 4.5.0)

Download the [source code folder](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/archive/z3-4.5.0.zip).

Decompress the folder and install it.
```
 unzip z3-z3-4.5.0.zip
 cd z3-z3-4.5.0
 python scripts/mk_make.py --python
 cd build
 make
 sudo make install
```
### 4. Install dependencies (last pip version tested 8.1.1)
   
Use `pip install` command to install six, requests python libraries.

```
pip3 install six
pip3 install requests
pip3 install semantic_version
```
The above commands may fail depending on the pip version. If it is the case, run the following command instead of the   previous ones.

```
python3 -m pip install six
python3 -m pip install requests
python3 -m pip install semantic_version
```

To check the version run the command `pip -V`.

## Run EthIR

To execute EthIR, run one of the following commands inside the folder *ethir*:

1. Run EthIR from a solidity file:
```
./ethir.py -s file_name.sol
```
2. Run EthIR from an EVM file:
```
./ethir.py -s file_name.evm -b 
```
3. Run EthIR from a disassembly EVM file:
```
./ethir.py -s file_name.disasm -disasm 
```

### Options
The command `./ethir.py -h` displays a list with all the available options of EthIR. Some of the most relevant ones are:

1. Store the control-flow-graph in text mode and graphically in a dot file:
```
./ethir.py -s filename -cfg normal
```
2. Generate SACO RBR
```
./ethir.py -s filename -saco
```
3. Display debug information:
```
./ethir.py -s filename -d
```

All the files generated by EthIR during its execution are stored in the direcrtory /tmp/costabs/ .

### Running Example
Once EthIR is installed, suppose we want to generate the RBR of the disassembly file *blockking.evm.disasm* available in the folder *[examples](https://github.com/costa-group/EthIR/tree/master/examples)*. First, we have to go to *ethir* directory and execute the command `./ethir.py -s ../examples/blockking.evm.disasm -disasm` there.

During the execution, EthIR has created the directory */tmp/costabs/* where it stores the RBR associated with *blockking.evm.disasm* file. If we inspect this directory, we find a file named *rbr.rbr* that contains the RBR. If we open the file with any common editor (gedit, emacs) we can see the rbr generated. Below is a skecth of the RBR generated for *blockking.evm.disasm* file:
```

	s(0) = 96
	s(1) = 64
	l(0) = s(0)
	s(0) = calldatasize
	call(jump0(s(0),g(11), g(10), g(9), g(8), g(7), g(6), g(5), g(4), g(3), g(2), g(1), g(0), l(8), l(7), l(6), l(5), l(4), l(3), l(2), l(1), l(0), calldatasize, calldataload, gas, caller, callvalue, number, gasprice, balance))

	eq(s(0), 0)
	call(block174(g(11), g(8), g(4), g(1), g(0), l(7), l(6), l(5), l(4), l(3), l(2), l(1), l(0), caller, callvalue, gas, gasprice, number))

	neq(s(0), 0)
	call(block11(g(11), g(10), g(9), g(8), g(7), g(6), g(5), g(4), g(3), g(2), g(1), g(0), l(7), l(6), l(5), l(4), l(3), l(2), l(1), l(0), balance, calldataload, caller, callvalue, gas, gasprice, number))
 
block11(g(11), g(10), g(9), g(8), g(7), g(6), g(5), g(4), g(3), g(2), g(1), g(0), l(7), l(6), l(5), l(4), l(3), l(2), l(1), l(0), balance, calldataload, caller, callvalue, gas, gasprice, number)=>
	s(0) = 224
	s(1) = 2
	s(0) = s(1)^s(0)
	s(1) = 0
	s(1) = calldataload
	s(0) = s(1)/s(0)
	s(1) = 607252836
	s(2) = s(0)
	call(jump11(s(2),s(1),s(0),g(11), g(10), g(9), g(8), g(7), g(6), g(5), g(4), g(3), g(2), g(1), g(0), l(7), l(6), l(5), l(4), l(3), l(2), l(1), l(0), balance, calldataload, caller, callvalue, gas, gasprice, number))
```
If we execute the command `./ethir.py -s ../examples/blockking.evm.disasm -disasm -eop` instead of the above one, the RBR that EthIR produces has nops annotations, with the EVM bytecode interleaved in the text. Below is a sketch of the RBR with nops annotations generated for *blockking.evm.disasm*:

EthIR also allows us to store the CFG of the file analysed. In that case, we have to execute the command `./ethir.py -s ../examples/blockking.evm.disasm -disasm -cfg`. EthIR stores the cfg in a file with *.cfg* extension in the directory */tmp/costabs/*.

Note that a file may contain more than one smart contract. In that case, EthIR generates one file per each contract rbr0.rbr, rbr1.rbr,...rbrn.rbr .

## Smart Contract Examples
The folder *[examples](https://github.com/costa-group/EthIR/tree/master/examples)* contains running examples to test the tool. There are both solidity, evm and disassembly files.

Most of the examples such as bloccking.evm.disasm, advertisement.sol, validToken.sol or cryptoPhoenix.sol are real-world contracts obtained from the blockchain while others such as loop1.sol and sum.sol are ad-hoc examples where it is easier to understand the decompilation process.

## Bounding Loops using SACO
[SACO](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/saco/web/) is a static analyzer for concurrent objects which, is able to infer, among other properties,*upper bounds* on the number of iterations of loops. Note that this is the first crucial step to infer the gas
consumption of smart contracts.

The internal representation of [SACO](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/saco/web/) matches the grammar of the RBR generated by EthIR after minor syntactic translations. Thanks to this, it is able to prove termination of the loops that some of the examples contain and produce a linear
bound for those loops. Here are some of the loop bounds inferred by [SACO](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/saco/web/) for some of the smart contracts contained in folder [*examples*](https://github.com/costa-group/EthIR/tree/master/examples):

|Smart Contract|Bound|Smart Contract|Bound|
|--|--|--|--|
| BlockKing | nat(g8/10)*36+8934493 | CryptoPhoenix | nat(g3)*228409344+4113285485 |
| Loop1 | nat(a)*25+234 | Eligma | nat(_numberOfReturns)*2628+134 |
| Lottery | 159 | BlockSquareSerieA | 286 |
| Enclaves | 268 | AuctusEther | 264 |
| Advertisement | inf |  validToken | inf |

[SACO](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/saco/web/) infers a linear bound for the first four smart contracts shown in the table above. The bounds of smart contracts BlockKing and CryptoPhoenix depend on the value of one of their fields (the eighth and third respectively). For smart contracts Loop1 and Eligma, the bounds obtained rely on arguments of some of its functions (a and _numberOfReturns). In case smart contracts do not contain any loop as Lottery, BlockSquareSerieA, Enclaves or AuctusEther, [SACO](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/saco/web/) infers a constant bound.

Note that due to precision limitations of [SACO](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/saco/web/) (it does not have bit-operations and a model for function sha3) the analyzer forgets the information on bit variables. Due to this factor, [SACO](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/saco/web/) is not able to infer a bound for some of the smart contracts such as ValidToken or Advertisement and returns *inf*.

Other high-level analyzers that work on intermediate forms like Integer transition systems or Horn clauses  (e.g., AproVe, T2, VeryMax, CoFloCo) could be easily adapted as well to work on RBR translated programs produced by EthIR. 

If you are interesting in using EthIR jointly with [SACO](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/saco/web/) contact [SACO](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/saco/web/) developers through a pull-request or a new issue.

You can try a first prototype [here](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/gastap). GASTAP infers an upper-bound of the gas involved in each transaction.
